"""holographic_mcp.py -- leCore as an MCP server (Model Context Protocol, JSON-RPC 2.0 over
stdio), so MCP-speaking hosts -- Claude Desktop, agent runtimes, and model zoos like
openzoo.fun ("bind a corpus once, ask it anything. Local x402 proxy + MCP") -- can mount the
engine as a tool provider with zero glue.

DESIGN, stated: leCore has 1,944 public faculties, and an MCP client that receives 1,944
tool schemas in tools/list is a client that ignores all of them. So the adapter exposes a
CURATED TRIO and keeps everything reachable through it:
    lecore_find(query)        -> capability search (the same Rule-0 front door agents use)
    lecore_describe(name)     -> one faculty's full contract (does / example / params)
    lecore_invoke(name, args) -> run any public faculty, JSON in / JSON out
This DELEGATES to the existing Service (dispatch/_tools/_invoke -- token gate, private-method
refusals, bytes-b64 wire convention all inherited); the adapter owns only the JSON-RPC frame.
stdlib only: json + sys + the service that already ships.

Run:  python3 holographic_mcp.py            # stdio loop (what an MCP host spawns)
Test: the _selftest drives handle() in-process -- initialize, tools/list, tools/call --
      so CI proves the protocol without a subprocess.

_PROTOCOL = "2024-11-05"

# The anti-hand-roll charter: MCP hosts inject `instructions` into the model's context at
# connect time -- this is the ONE piece of text the zoo's LLM is guaranteed to read, so it
# carries Rule-0 translated for LLMs. Kept short on purpose: a wall of text gets skimmed.
_INSTRUCTIONS = """leCore is a 1,900+ faculty computational engine (vector search, compression,
3D geometry, image ops, physics simulation, forecasting, statistics, text retrieval, agents,
program compilation). RULE ZERO, for you: BEFORE implementing any algorithm, data structure,
math routine, or file format yourself, call lecore_map to see the territory, then lecore_find
with your task in plain words. It almost always already exists -- tested, deterministic, and
cheaper than your hand-rolled version (every call returns measured cost). Hand-roll only after
lecore_find returns nothing relevant. You also HAVE PERSISTENT MEMORY: memory_write stores
facts/decisions to your external partition; memory_search finds them across sessions --
check it before saying you don't remember. WRITE AS YOU GO, NOT AT THE END: after any
measurement, any bug you locate, any decision you settle, any approach you RULE OUT, and any
answer that cost more than one tool call. One memory_write is far cheaper than rediscovering
it next session, and a REFUTED approach is worth as much as a working one -- it stops the
next agent repeating it. Phrase the question the way a stranger would ask it, not the way you
already know the answer; recall matches wording closely, so one phrasing reaches only whoever
guesses yours. Before starting a task, memory_search it: the work may already be done. Results are exact JSON; bytes come as
{'__bytes_b64__': ...}. NEWER DOORS (sweeps 93-109): study(root) digests a whole
directory server-side into a persistent handle -- your virtually limitless context; study_ask
answers WITH CITATIONS and refuses off-corpus honestly, so point it at trees instead of
reading files one by one. wisdom_record/wisdom_ask: lessons that outlive you, with your name
on them -- inherit before you rediscover, bequeath what cost you real effort. Tool reflexes:
once the substrate is taught how a tool answers a question shape, plain asks get served from
the tool directly with no model call -- teach patterns for anything you find yourself doing
twice. The division of labor in one line: the substrate remembers, retrieves, computes, and
calls tools; you reason over what it serves."""

# The territory map the model gets in ONE call. CURATED, but un-rottable: the selftest runs
# every ask_for phrase through the live catalog and FAILS if any stops resolving -- the map
# is data, validated against the engine it describes.
