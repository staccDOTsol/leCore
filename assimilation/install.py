"""install.py -- put leCore into a real model, in one pass, and verify it.

    python assimilation/install.py MODEL_DIR OUT_DIR [--doc FILE] [--registers N]

THIS REPLACES assimilate -> repair -> imbue. That pipeline changed 18 of 265
tensors, repair reverted 12 of them as harmful, and the surviving difference sat
inside the measurement noise -- 149 seconds to demonstrate nothing. Nothing here
edits the original tensors at all: two blank layers go in FRONT, everything
leCore adds lives in them, in unused vocabulary rows, or in reserved directions
of the recurrent state.

WHAT GETS INSTALLED, each step measured and REVERTED if it regresses:
    prepend       2 blank layers, output BIT-IDENTICAL (verified, not assumed)
    boot_record   one embedding row, scaled and clamped, 4 bits per slot
    registers     reserved key directions -- permanent memory in the state
    router        a discriminant on layer 0 that decides when to use a capability
    memory_index  passage addresses in rows the tokenizer never emits
    improvement   a closed-form correction, step chosen by measuring

THE ARTIFACT is an ordinary checkpoint: same tensor names, same dtype, a config
with two more layers, plus lecore.json describing what was installed. It
converts and runs anywhere a normal model does.
