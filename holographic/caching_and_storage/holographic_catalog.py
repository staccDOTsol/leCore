"""holographic_catalog.py -- the capability CATALOG (consolidation backlog C1): "search before you build".

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The engine has grown to ~340 modules, and the recurring cost is DUPLICATION: the same job (search a pile of
vectors, bake a slow factor and look it up, represent a field) is often already solved somewhere, but a new
session -- human or AI -- can't easily find it and builds a fourth copy. This catalog is the index of what exists.
Describe a problem in plain English and it points you at the home that already does it.

Each entry says, in plain English, what it DOES, gives a copy-paste EXAMPLE, and flags whether it is NATIVE
(stays in the batched / fusable vector domain) or hops to Python. `find_capability` runs a small, READABLE
token-overlap match over the entries -- no training, fully deterministic -- so "search a big pile of vectors"
finds the search index without anyone having to know its module name.

This PROMOTES two shipped things into one home: the auto-listing of the mind's public faculties
(holographic_query.capability_registry, which builds a SQL-queryable table) and query-by-description. The catalog
is the richer home (does/example/native + find); `seed_from_mind` reuses the faculty walk so every faculty is
findable, and `to_rows` can still hand the entries to the SQL table path. NumPy-free, stdlib only.

def _strip_filler(text):
    """Remove leading conversational prefixes from a query, repeatedly, until none matches.

    WHY THIS IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH _STOP, which is the obvious objection: the stop-word list ALREADY drops
    'how', 'do', 'i', so `_tokens('how do i smooth a bumpy mesh')` and `_tokens('smooth a bumpy mesh')` are
    ALREADY identical. Stripping fillers to help the TOKEN match would therefore be pure ceremony.

    What actually breaks is the EXACT-ALIAS BONUS below, which is a whole-string equality test worth +5.0 --
    by far the largest term in the score. Any prefix at all, even one whose every token is a stop word, makes
    `q_phrase != alias` and silently forfeits it. MEASURED over 150 author aliases (>=4 words): exact phrasing
    top-1 99.3%, and EVERY fully-stopped filler lands on exactly 91.3% -- identical, because they all destroy
    the same bonus and nothing else. ("what's the best way to" is worse at 81.3%: it also leaks the content
    words 'best' and 'way', which add spurious overlap elsewhere.)

    So the fix has to reach the PHRASE, not the tokens. A change that only touched tokenization would ship
    green and move nothing.

    Returns the normalised, stripped phrase. If stripping would consume the whole query, the original is kept
    -- 'please' alone is a query about nothing, but it is not improved by becoming the empty string."""

        z=-0.9 and z=-1.5 (below the null MEAN -- word salad matches scattered prose better than a wrong
        real query does), while the weakest genuine queries tested ('screen a battery of detectors',
        'non-manifold repair') sit at z=+1.02; a first draft at z_min=2.0 abstained on them outright, and a
        line AT 1.0 clipped them (rounding is not a margin). 0.8 leaves the weakest-true population 0.2
        above the line and the misroutes 1.7 sigma below it; recalibration is owed whenever the catalog's
        vocabulary shifts substantially (kept negative 1 below).

        KEPT NEGATIVES: (1) abstention is calibrated to the catalog's CURRENT vocabulary -- a new family of
        capabilities shifts the null, so z values are not comparable across catalog versions; (2) a genuine
        query phrased entirely in words the catalog never uses will abstain -- that abstention is CORRECT
        behaviour (the catalog truly has no purchase on it), but it reads as a false negative to a user who
        knows a capability exists under other words; the fix is aliases, not a lower z_min."""
