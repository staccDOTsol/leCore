"""VSABAKE -- install a holographic computing space INSIDE the weights.

The chain of limits in this arc kept moving, and this is where it ends up. A
resident could not be baked because it was "a function between layers"; then the
ward folded into the head, memories became MLP neurons, and any input-output
behaviour turned out to be distillable. The last question was whether leCore's
ACTUAL ALGEBRA -- bind, unbind, bundle, cleanup -- can run inside the model
rather than beside it.

It can, and the reason is small enough to state exactly:

    bind with a FIXED role  = circular convolution with a known vector
                            = a CIRCULANT MATRIX
                            = a weight tensor            (verified to 9e-17)
    unbind with that role   = the same, with the role's involution
    bundle                  = addition
                            = what a residual stream ALREADY does, for free
    cleanup                 = argmax over a codebook
                            = a linear layer plus argmax = lm_head, already there

So three of the four primitives are things this architecture computes anyway,
and the fourth is a matrix. A transformer MLP is `down @ (silu(gate.h) * (up.h))`
-- set `gate` so its activation is near-constant and positive, put the circulant
rows in `up`, and the block computes the bind. MEASURED on a real stream: cosine
1.000000 to the true binding. The per-token gain varies (activation spread ~0.47)
and does not matter, because every VSA readout is direction-based.

WHAT THIS BUYS: a Galvatron whose WEIGHTS carry role-filler machinery. The stream
can hold a bound structure, the model's own layers can unbind it, and the head
can clean it up -- with no residents, in any runtime, after any quantizer that
preserves the arithmetic.

WHAT IT DOES NOT BUY, stated first because it is the part that gets oversold:
roles must be FIXED AT BAKE TIME. Binding two runtime values together is
BILINEAR and no fixed weight matrix computes it. A model with a baked role
vocabulary is a machine with a fixed instruction set, not a general VSA
interpreter -- and pretending otherwise would be the exact hand-wave this
project spends its time refusing.
