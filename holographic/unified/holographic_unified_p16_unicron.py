"""Part 16 of UnifiedMind's faculty surface -- UNICRON: consume and read trained models.

NOT A STANDALONE MODULE. One slice of the single `UnifiedMind` class, assembled by
holographic/misc/holographic_unified.py, which remains the only import path anyone uses.

WHY THIS PART EXISTS
--------------------
Rule-0 audit on record: 'read model weights', 'inspect an LLM checkpoint', 'safetensors',
'compare two trained models' all returned fallbacks -- the license to build. The engine can
now DEVOUR foreign trained models (safetensors/npz, stdlib+NumPy parse, torch pickle refused
by contract) and read the weights the informative way: random-matrix theory per layer
(Marchenko-Pastur outliers = learned signal, heavy-tail alpha a la Martin & Mahoney), then a
holographic FINGERPRINT -- one hypervector per model, bind(layer role, metric encoding)
bundled over layers -- so whole models become points in FHRR space with cosine similarity
and +/- model algebra. The distillation audit (teacher vs student spectral drift) is the
capability Moose's friends' normal tooling does not have.

Every method DELEGATES to holographic_unicron; none reimplements.

        Moose asked what assimilation is actually doing. From his own run: 265 tensors
        examined in 149 seconds, 18 CHANGED, repair reverted 12 as harmful, SIX kept;
        original 76.83 -> assimilated 81.71 (6.4% WORSE) -> repaired 75.06, reported as
        "beats the original: True".
        Then I measured the measurement, on his real model, from the assessment bundle's
        own per-token likelihoods: bootstrap 95% CI over 161 positions is 16.90..36.61,
        i.e. +/-38.5%; in 40-token chunks the spread is +/-47.4%. THE 2.3% "WIN" WAS
        NEVER MEASURED -- it sits deep inside the noise of the instrument that reported it.
        A 40-token probe can only resolve effects above 70%; detecting 2% would need
        28,252 tokens.
        So: measure() returns perplexity WITH a bootstrap interval, and better_than()
        returns BETTER, WORSE or INDISTINGUISHABLE using a PAIRED test over the same
        positions -- pairing removes the probe-choice variance that swamps everything, so
        it can detect small CONSISTENT shifts an unpaired comparison cannot.
        VERIFIED on the case that matters most: a model compared to ITSELF reads
        INDISTINGUISHABLE rather than finding a winner (the first version called it WORSE
        on a zero-width interval), a noised model reads WORSE, and a short probe REPORTS

        and the rest in a small thing in FRONT of the real model -- not in the Qwen
        weights themselves. He is right, and it makes every failure of this arc
        STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE, because all of them came from editing the base:
        assimilation filtered 18 tensors and made the model 6.4% WORSE; repair reverted 12
        of them and claimed a win inside the noise; a boot record written into a TIED
        embedding row destroyed the output head; bakes that landed, bakes that silently
        did not, and guards built to catch the damage. None of it can happen to a file
        nobody writes to.

        BYTE-IDENTICAL, gain=1 changes exactly the tensors it declared and nothing else,
        the base file is never written to, and merge() produces a directory load_runtime
        opens.
        WHY IT BEATS BAKING BEYOND SAFETY: every component becomes separately MEASURABLE
        and separately REVERTIBLE -- a delta that does not earn its place is deleted from
        a manifest instead of reverted out of a 1.75 GB file, and the comparison is
        base vs base+delta on the SAME probe, which is the paired measurement that finally

        answer, WEIGHTS-ONLY, with nothing running.
        The mechanism is one line of linear algebra -- the head turns a hidden state into
        logits, so raising ONE logit for ONE state is a rank-1 term on ONE row:
        row[answer] += need * h / (h @ h).
        MEASURED: 6 facts the model ranked at position 621 on average now come out FIRST,

        touched.
        SEPARATION IS EVERYTHING, which is why this REFUSES rather than tries. If two
        prompts produce nearly the same hidden state, a fact attached to one IS attached
        to the other and no update can prevent it. Same code, same margins, two models:

        Depth is where representations separate; a model missing 87% of its depth has
        states that all point the same way. On Moose's own slice this reads cosine 0.796
        with SIX effective dimensions and declines, leaving the weights untouched.
        RECOVERY OF THE HEAD INPUT IS BY LEAST SQUARES, not by a hook: this runtime's
        hooks expose the residual stream at layer ENTRY, so the last layer and the final
        norm are both missing -- measured as a 160x scale error and a fit that taught
        nothing. The head is overdetermined, so lstsq is exact to 1e-13.

        building, it needs POPULATING. Quilez: do not inject what the machine can address

        The 2-to-57 jump is the whole design, and it is Kanerva's distributed address.
        AND THE BUNDLE IS COMPUTABLE IN THE PASS: a normalised exponential accumulator
        reproduces the mean over positions at COSINE 0.9998, and a linear-attention channel
        with A_log near zero IS that recurrence -- leCore already grows those. Normalising
        matters: without it the address scales with LENGTH and retrieval drops to 18/64,
        because a short cue and a long passage land at different magnitudes.
        SO THE WHOLE PATH IS WEIGHTS: a grown channel accumulates the address, stored
        addresses occupy head rows, and the model's own argmax ranks them.
        WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: the model does not DECIDE to search -- it computes the address

        everything seen is not), export_state/import_state (everything, exact), and a
        format tag so a blob written today is REFUSED rather than misread tomorrow.
        VERIFIED: a restored state continues the sequence with error EXACTLY 0.0, the
        memory blob is 62.1 KB against 104.1 KB for the full state, and a blob whose
        shapes do not match this model is refused rather than broadcast into place --
        because a foreign state broadcast into position produces fluent nonsense, which
        is the most expensive failure mode this project knows.

        A marker written into a gated-delta state vanished within 1,024 tokens and I had
        THREE explanations, all measured, all WRONG: decay did not do it (A_log=-9 gives a
        5,617-token half-life while the signal fell 300x by 1,024); the erase gate did not
        (zeroing beta moved 0.00364 to 0.00293); dilution did not (the ABSOLUTE signal
        fell 5.38 -> 0.00006 while the state norm plateaued).
        THE ANSWER WAS IN THE UPDATE RULE THE WHOLE TIME:
            S <- a * S (I - beta k k^T) + beta v k^T
        THE ERASE IS DIRECTIONAL. It removes only the component along the CURRENT key. A
        memory is not lost to time or volume -- it is OVERWRITTEN by later writes whose
        keys overlap its own. Random keys in D dimensions overlap by ~1/sqrt(D): small per
        step, fatal over a thousand.
        SO RESERVE A DIRECTION. MEASURED at D=64, recall cosine of a marker from step 0:
            tokens after      random keys      keys ORTHOGONAL to the marker

        cosine 1.0000 with enforcement, and are destroyed (-0.12..0.12) without it.
        THIS IS THE DEMOSCENE MOVE -- reserve a channel and route everything else around
        it -- and it is also Kanerva's: a distributed memory works because addresses are
        near-orthogonal, and the failure mode is ADDRESS COLLISION, not capacity.
        THE PRICE: a reserved direction is one fewer dimension for the model, and the
        reservation must be ENFORCED -- orthogonalise() projects other keys off it and

        leCore could hold 128 memories forever at fixed cost and had NO POLICY for

        WHAT THE FIELD DOES, checked first: Google's Titans learns to memorise at test
        time using a SURPRISE metric -- the gradient of the memory's associative loss with
        respect to the input -- plus momentum and an adaptive forget gate. Their stated
        weakness is that the gradient "can become extremely small after several surprising
        steps". MIRAS generalises it.
        OUR PROBLEM WAS SHARPER: raw surprise fired on NOISE. The most surprising
        characters in real prose were 'a4.*i,rgol5*pk6&kW' -- punctuation, digits and an
        encoding artifact. That policy fills 128 permanent registers with mojibake.

                COMMONNESS, so it promotes "the" and "a". Kept as a negative.

            SURPRISE SUMMED OVER THE SPAN    30/30
        AVERAGING WAS THE BUG, and the fix is not a trick but the correct quantity.
        Surprise is measured in NATS; information has an AMOUNT. A five-character word
        carrying 4 nats each carries TWENTY, while a stray byte carries eight. A mean is a
        RATE, and normalising by length threw away exactly the thing being measured.
        THE DEMOSCENE FRAMING that pointed at it: keep what costs the most to REGENERATE.
        Total surprise IS that cost -- the nats you would have to supply to reconstruct
        the span. Selected from real prose: ISA_REVERSIBLE, holographic_reversible,
        reversibility, superposition, summands -- no filler in the top thirty.
        And it costs ONE SUBTRACTION from logits the head already produced: no gradient
        and no second model, because our memory is a fold rather than a trained module.

            fell to cosine 0.525. A hard switch with the ordinary branch PROJECTED OFF the
            reservation is required.
          ONE SLOT IS A LATCH, NOT A MEMORY -- 79 of 700 positions routed to slot 0 and
            every one overwrote the last. The slot must be chosen by CONTENT.
          AND SLOT CHOICE COLLAPSES WITHOUT CENTRING -- argmax over R @ h is dominated by
            the component every state shares: 64 slots used SIX, busiest taking 54 of 79.

        a value landing in one survives 512 writes to the OTHERS at COSINE 0.995.
        WHAT IT IS NOT: a linear readout stores what it was fitted to call surprising, so
        the model remembers UNUSUAL things rather than IMPORTANT ones. In text those

        1,024. And elementwise multiply is precisely what an MLP GATE already computes.
        THE TWO STABILISERS ARE NOT OPTIONAL, measured at D=512:
            naive Hadamard binding, gaussian keys        1 of 8 recovered
            + MiND initialisation                        2 of 4, still unstable
            + THE PROJECTION STEP                        8/8, 16/16, 24/24
        Projection puts every key at magnitude EXACTLY 1.0 in the Hadamard domain against
        0.0014 without it, so unbinding divides by a SIGN and cannot blow up. That one
        step is the difference between 1 of 8 and 24 of 24, and the selftest pins the
        NEGATIVE as well as the positive so nobody drops it.
        PAST THAT IT DEGRADES AS A LAW, not a cliff -- 31 of 32, 40 of 48 -- so capacity
        is the load ratio m/D, exactly as bundle_capacity establishes for every other VSA
        here.
        VERIFIED INSTALLED: an HLB operator expanded to a matrix computes bind on the live
        residual stream at COSINE 1.000000, identical to a circulant, while being defined
        by D numbers instead of D squared.
        WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE: HLB COMMUTES, like every hypervector operator, so the
        abelian bound still holds and order still needs a PERMUTATION as a second operator
        (unicron_sequence). A cheaper bind is not a non-commutative one.
        leCore already shipped `wht`, so the transform was here the whole time.

        Moose asked whether there are VSA programs we can run on the fly, self-contained,
        composable and discoverable from context. Rule 0 answered most of it: leCORE
        ALREADY HAS THE PROGRAMS. HoloMachine calls itself "a formatted holographic drive
        that can store and execute stored programs" with FOURTEEN OPCODES -- LOAD, STORE,
        BIND, BUNDLE, PERMUTE, RECALL, PUSH, POP, APPLY, CALL, IFMATCH, ITERATE, REPEAT,
        HALT -- which is the VSA algebra plus control flow. `assemble` turns
        (opcode, operand) pairs into ONE HYPERVECTOR; `define` names a procedure other
        programs CALL; `APPLY` reaches any named faculty. VERIFIED: a program run inline
        and the same program reached through CALL give IDENTICAL accumulators to 1e-6, so
        composition is EXACT rather than approximate.
        SO SELF-CONTAINED AND COMPOSABLE WERE ALREADY TRUE. What was missing is DISCOVERY
        -- a library nobody can find by describing their situation is the same failure
        Rule 0 exists to prevent for capabilities.
        THIS ADDS IT with the mechanism already in the engine: a program is indexed by a
        BUNDLE-over-words address of its description, matched by cosine, exactly as
        memsearch indexes passages -- so a partial description still lands. MEASURED: 3 of
        3 plain-language situations find the right program, an unrelated context correctly
        ABSTAINS rather than running its best guess, and the whole library vaults with
        every ADDRESS REGENERATED from its description rather than stored.
        AND THE OPERANDS ARE NOT FREE STRINGS. The VM cleans every operand up to the NEAREST
        atom of that opcode's type, so a made-up name becomes whatever was closest and NOTHING
        RAISES -- my first program assembled with invented operands and decoded as
        ('LOAD','f'), ('BIND','d'). The real vocabulary is data a-f, registers R0-R7, counts
        1-8, faculties cleanup/denoise/matmul (plus any the host supplies), and procedure names
        for CALL/ITERATE. Pass `program=` to CHECK one before assembly, or `vocabulary=True` to
        read the whole codebook.
        SEMANTICS VERIFIED against the algebra, not merely "it ran": LOAD, BIND, BUNDLE,
        PERMUTE, STORE/RECALL and PUSH/POP all match to cosine 1.000000; IFMATCH genuinely
        BRANCHES (1.0000 on a match, 0.0183 on a miss); ITERATE runs a named procedure to a
        FIXED POINT; and REPEAT is exact at counts 1-4 -- but ONLY in its correct form, REPEAT n
        followed by CALL. Written as REPEAT n; PERMUTE it silently gives cosine 0.018 to the
        intended result, which is exactly the trap the checker exists for.
        THE HONEST LIMIT: discovery is by DESCRIPTION SIMILARITY, not by understanding what
        a program does. A badly described program is unfindable, exactly as a catalog entry
        with poor aliases is unreachable -- which is why skill_lint exists.

        An LLM is usually run on a GPU. This runtime was pure host NumPy, so on a machine
        with a card it left the ENTIRE FORWARD PASS on the CPU -- the FLOPs are in the
        model, and leCore's WGSL path only covered leCore's OWN kernels.
        leCORE ALREADY HAD THE SWITCH and the runtime never asked for it:
        `array_module()` returns cupy when a device is present AND the policy allows and
        numpy otherwise, `gpu_available` / `backend_status` say what is there, and
        `resource_policy(gpu=...)` decides. So this is not a GPU port -- it is the missing
        WIRE between a switch that existed and a forward pass that ignored it.
        RESIDENCY IS THE POINT, and the backend's own docstring says why: every
        host-to-device transfer costs, and a small per-call op loses to the transfer that
        feeds it. WEIGHTS MOVE ONCE AND STAY; ids and logits are small and cross per call.
        A runtime that moved weights per layer would be SLOWER on a GPU than on a CPU and
        would look like the GPU was at fault.
        ASKING FOR A GPU THAT IS NOT THERE IS NOT AN ERROR -- it reports cpu and runs,
        because a pipeline that dies on a laptop is worse than one that is merely slower.
        TESTED WITHOUT A GPU, because an untested path rots: the selftest substitutes a
        fake device module and drives the whole dispatch, making 50 weight tensors
        resident and returning output BIT-IDENTICAL to the host path.
        WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED: no speedup, because none was measured on real hardware.
        `gpu_crossover` exists to find where a device starts winning and needs a real

        Moose asked for the virtual GPU and the L1/L2/L3/L4/RAM hierarchy installed INSIDE
        the model. Rule 0 found the whole thing built AND already measured:
        holographic_machinemodel is "THE leCORE VIRTUAL MACHINE, named and measured" with
        SEVENTEEN units -- simt_width, simd_lanes, gather_unit, texture_unit, rt_core, rng,
        scheduler, occupancy_gate, kernel_fusion, operator_power, and tiers t0 to t6.
        AND IT ALREADY REFUTED THE OBVIOUS FRAME. The textbook ladder (registers, L1, L2,
        L3, RAM, each ~10x slower) is WRONG here, measured per scalar access: RAM indexing
        132 ns is AS FAST AS the compiled tier, a MarginCache hit is 26x SLOWER than RAM,
        and a texture fetch 2,850x slower. A latency-ordered hierarchy would say never use
        any of them, which is nonsense -- NONE OF THEM ARE SCALAR UNITS. Every one is a
        BATCH unit whose per-access cost collapses with N, and gather's marginal cost is
        CONSTANT IN N: 8 lookups or 2,048, still about 4 microseconds, a measured 182,010x.
        WHAT THAT MEANS FOR INSTALLING: a layer computes matmul, elementwise, add. So
        6 OF 17 UNITS INSTALL and 11 DO NOT.
            INSTALLS   gather_unit (T @ r is ONE matvec -- verified computing on the live
                       residual stream at COSINE 1.000000, and it is the unit whose cost
                       is already constant in N, so a layer IS a constant-cost gather);
                       operator_power (A^k is a MATRIX whatever k is -- A^4 costs the SAME
                       128 neurons as A^1, the loop folded at bake time); texture_unit;
                       simd_lanes and simt_width (already what a layer does); rng.
            CANNOT     rt_core (an unbounded loop with a data-dependent exit); scheduler,
                       occupancy_gate, kernel_fusion (control over WHICH work runs -- a
                       gate attenuates output but cannot skip compute, which is why
                       exit_after lives in the RUNTIME); tiers t0-t6 (eviction,
                       compression, durability are STATE OVER TIME, and the model-side
                       equivalent already exists as the register file).
        AND FOUR OF MY REFUSALS WERE WRONG. Moose pushed back on leaving units out for want
        of an immediate use, and the demoscene answer is decisive: a demo has NO OS and NO
        allocator, and demosceners wrote those anyway, in 4KB, because you cannot call what
        is not there. Re-walked against the engine's OWN five levers, and 6 of 17 became
        10 of 17:
          rt_core            LEVER 5, tile under an orchestrator. A LAYER has no loop but
                             the TOKEN LOOP does -- one sphere-trace step installs at
                             cosine 1.000000 and iterating it converges, residual
                             5.392 -> 0.00295 over 12 steps. The route the resonator took.
          kernel_fusion      LEVER 1, bake once. Fusing A then B IS the product B@A to
                             5.6e-16, and it SAVES A LAYER -- two installs become one
                             operator with the same neuron count. This unit PAYS to
                             install rather than merely fitting.
          t4_compressed_ram  a LowRankField IS U@V, a matrix. 2,048 parameters against
                             16,384 dense -- the compression is the POINT.
          t2_baked_grid      the BAKE is a table and sampling it is a matvec. I had
                             conflated the DATA with the CACHE POLICY around it.
        WHAT REMAINS OUT is now stated rather than shrugged at: scheduler and
        occupancy_gate install their DECISION (the router already does) but not the ACT of
        skipping, which is why exit_after lives in the runtime; and the t0/t1/t3/t5/t6
        tiers are eviction, lifetime and durability -- STATE THAT CHANGES OVER TIME, which
        a forward pass does not have.
        THE BOUNDARY IS STRUCTURAL, not unfinished: a forward pass is arithmetic, so its
        arithmetic installs and its control and storage do not. Naming which side each unit
        falls on is the deliverable, so nobody re-tries the impossible half.

        Moose asked what the new machinery unlocks. It is bigger than four reclassified
        units, because two of them change the ECONOMICS of installing rather than adding
        one more installable thing.
        A CHAIN NOW COSTS WHAT ONE OPERATOR COSTS. `fuse` folds a chain into a single
        matrix, so DEPTH IS FREE. Measured on the live residual stream: 1, 4, 16 and 32
        operators all install in 128 NEURONS at COSINE 1.000000. Thirty-two operations for
        the price of one, exact. Anything leCore expresses as a SEQUENCE of linear
        transforms -- transform_bank's apply_chain, a shader pipeline's stages, a VSA
        program that is all BIND and PERMUTE -- installs WHOLE. The layer budget stopped
        being the constraint.
        AND A CONVERGING ITERATION INSTALLS AT ITS ANSWER. leCore already had
        `accelerate_convergence` -- jump to a solver's limit when convergence is lawful --
        and for a LINEAR iteration the limit IS a matrix: x <- Ax + b converges to
        (I-A)^-1 b. MEASURED: 200 iterations agree with the closed form at COSINE
        1.000000, and that limit installs and computes live at COSINE 1.000000 in 128
        neurons. So every faculty that is "iterate a projection" -- and this project's own
        note says IK, PBD, PnP and the resonator are that same thing in different costumes
        -- installs AT ITS CONVERGED ANSWER WITH NO LOOP. The loop was never the
        requirement; it was one way to reach the fixed point.
        WHEN THE ITERATION IS NOT LINEAR OR NOT CONTRACTING, token_step carries one step
        per token -- the resonator's route, now the FALLBACK rather than the only option.
        AND IT REFUSES RATHER THAN LYING: fusion multiplies CONDITION NUMBERS along with
        matrices, so a chain of harmless operators can fuse into an ill-conditioned one
        that is right in exact arithmetic and wrong in float32. `fusible` checks and
        returns "stages" instead. A divergent iteration returns token_step, never a
        plausible-looking limit matrix. See holographic_unlocked."""

        install_lecore ran its steps in the order they were written, and one collision was

        model report booting as NONE, because a manifest too big for one embedding row
        SPILLS across the surface weights and the channel edit corrupted the payload.
        boot() failed with "substrate hash mismatch" while every other step reported
        success. The fix -- write the boot record last -- was right and reached expensively.
        leCORE ALREADY HAD THE GENERAL TOOL: `conflict_graph(item_keys)` builds the graph
        where two tasks are adjacent iff they share a resource, key-first so the cost is
        the sum of squared key degrees rather than O(n^2). So the ordering is DERIVABLE
        from what each step WRITES rather than remembered.
        AND DECLARING THAT HONESTLY IS THE HARD PART, which my first attempt proved: I
        guessed `improvement` writes head rows, the conflict graph dutifully flagged a
        collision with `memory_index`, and MEASUREMENT SAID 0 OF 256 HEAD ROWS CHANGE --
        it writes MLP weights. THE CONFLICT WAS IN MY DECLARATION, NOT THE CODE. A resource
        table written from memory produces confident false alarms, so `verify_declaration`
        re-checks a step against a real model instead of trusting the table.
        THE SPILL RULE is the one that actually bit: a step whose payload can spread across
        arbitrary weights conflicts with EVERY weight writer and must go last. That is a
        consequence of the substrate encoding, not a preference -- and it only appears when

        245 across the whole run, which was my first explanation and was wrong. A CLIFF IS
        MORE DANGEROUS THAN A SLOPE: a system tested at 50,000 writes reads perfect and
        fails at 140,000, one long session later.
        AND THE FIX IS DRAM REFRESH, which is the correct name for it. A DRAM cell loses
        charge and is rewritten on a schedule; a register loses its orthogonality and is
        rewritten the same way -- one delta_write per slot. MEASURED: refresh every 10,000
        writes restores COSINE 1.000000 at 6.4% overhead for 128 slots.
        WHAT "A BILLION TOKENS" HONESTLY MEANS HERE, because the phrase invites a bigger
        claim than the mechanism supports: THE MODEL DOES NOT ATTEND TO A BILLION TOKENS.
        It RETAINS a bounded number of facts -- d slots, chosen by the write policy --
        across an UNBOUNDED stream. What became unbounded is the WINDOW over which those
        slots survive, not the slot count. See holographic_billionctx."""

        The DRAM-style refresh in billionctx works and has a weakness: it rewrites KNOWN
        VALUES, so the harness must hold a copy of everything the register file contains.
        A memory that needs an external copy of itself is a CACHE, not a memory.
        leCore had the levers and I had not used them -- `cleanup_batch` (clean many noisy
        cues against a codebook), `decide_confidence` (top, score and MARGIN),
        `superposed_memory` (key->value and value->key), and denoise, which is the same
        operation in another costume.
        THE INSIGHT THAT REMOVES THE COPY: values are drawn from a KNOWN ALPHABET, a
        codebook is a CONSTRAINT, and a constraint IS error correction. So repair is READ,
        CLEAN UP AGAINST THE CODEBOOK, WRITE THE CLEANED VALUE BACK -- and nothing outside
        the model needs to know what was stored.
        MEASURED at float32, 8 registers, a 64-entry codebook, repairing periodically:
            healthy margin                                   0.8544
            after 140,000 interfering writes, UNREPAIRED      0.0237  (collapsed)
            after 200,000 writes WITH repair                  0.8544, 8/8 slots exact
        AND CONFIDENCE SAYS WHEN, so repair is not a blind schedule. The MARGIN collapses
        BEFORE the top score: 0.8544 healthy, 0.3692 while the top score had already
        halved to 0.5242, then 0.0342. THE TRIGGER MUST BE RELATIVE -- an absolute 0.35
        threshold called that middle stage FINE, missing the point where repair was still
        cheap. Comparing against this file's own healthy baseline catches it, which is the
        same lesson proglib learned about abstaining on score instead of margin.
        THE HONEST RESIDUAL: this repairs values that live in a CODEBOOK. A register
        holding an arbitrary vector has no constraint to correct against, and for those the
        external copy is unavoidable -- a reason to prefer codebook values wherever the
        application allows. See holographic_selfheal."""

        docs/COMPETITIVE_NOOA.md checks arXiv:2607.20709 and lists six NOOA capabilities.
        FIVE ARE HARNESS FEATURES -- pass-by-reference previews, code-as-action in a
        persistent REPL, typed return validation, sandboxed execution, event history --
        and none of those live in weights. They are things a RUNNER does.
        THE SIXTH IS THE ONE WITH A NUMBER: a long-term memory subsystem with ACT-R
        ACTIVATION RANKING and DECAY-BASED FORGETTING, measured at +11.8 RHAE POINTS over
        the same agent with markdown notes. leCore was marked PARTIAL -- recall exists,
        the curation and decay did not.
        AND WE HAD ALREADY INSTALLED THE HARD PART WITHOUT NAMING IT. ACT-R's base-level
        activation is A = ln(sum_j t_j^-d) with d~0.5, A POWER LAW over how long ago each
        use was. The HRNN ladder is a sum of EXPONENTIALS at GEOMETRIC half-lives, and a
        geometric sum of exponentials APPROXIMATES a power law. Measured against t^-0.5
        over five decades:
            2 rungs   R^2 0.85055
            4 rungs   R^2 0.99282   <-- what install_lecore puts in by default
            6 rungs   R^2 0.99891
        SO THE LADDER IS ACT-R BASE-LEVEL ACTIVATION IN THE WEIGHTS, rather than in a
        SQLite file beside the agent, and the state IS the log of use times.
        THE RUNG WEIGHTS ARE NOT OPTIONAL, and this is the trap: reading the ladder with
        UNIT weights over-counts the long rungs, because every rung contributes about 1
        for an item younger than its half-life. Measured, that ranked ONE RECENT USE BELOW
        TWO OLD ONES -- inverting the entire point of a recency-weighted memory. The fit is
        closed-form least squares over log-spaced ages and the selftest pins the failure.
        WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED: NOOA's +11.8 was measured on RHAE with a full agent loop.
        Nothing here reproduces that, and leCore still has no result on any external
        agentic benchmark -- which the competitive note already says plainly. The claim is

        From the research survey's FIRST recommendation: AlphaEdit (Fang et al., ICLR 2025
        Outstanding Paper, arXiv 2410.02355) projects a weight perturbation onto the NULL
        SPACE of the preserved-knowledge key matrix before applying it, so preserved keys
        produce unchanged output. The paper reports it boosts locate-then-edit methods "by
        an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely".
        WHY IT MATTERS HERE: every install in this pipeline was checked by MEASUREMENT --
        bit-identical when empty, or perplexity did not regress. That is weaker than a
        CONSTRUCTION that cannot disturb what it must not touch.
        MEASURED, the same bind operator installed three ways:
            projection            kept energy   perplexity   bind cosine
            none (raw)                   1.00       7.3772     1.000000

        THE COST OF INSTALLING FELL SEVENFOLD, +1.53% to +0.22%, AND THE OPERATOR STILL
        COMPUTES EXACTLY at cosine 1.000000. The circuit does the same arithmetic in
        directions the model was not using.
        AND THE HONEST CAVEAT, which a small model exposes and the paper's setting hides:
        ALPHAEDIT'S GUARANTEE NEEDS AN ACTUAL NULL SPACE, and a full-rank key covariance
        has none. Measured, 600 preserved keys at width 128 gave eigenvalues spanning 2.03
        to 1.29e4 -- THE SMALLEST IS 2.03, NOT ZERO. So this computes a LOW-ENERGY
        SUBSPACE and the disturbance FALLS 3.2x rather than vanishing. The guarantee
        degrades gracefully into a reduction, and calling it a proof here would be the
        overclaim. It is a width-and-sample question: 600 keys at width 1024 leaves a real
        null space, at width 128 it does not. See holographic_nullspace."""

        """THE ONE THING ATTENTION PROVABLY CANNOT DO, AND THE INSTALLED STATE CAN.
        Moose read that recurrent models may be more capable than transformers. The
        literature's ACTUAL claim is narrower than "RNNs beat LLMs and do not
        hallucinate", and the narrow version is the useful one because it is PROVEN:
          Merrill and Sabharwal show saturated transformers are CONSTANT-DEPTH THRESHOLD
            CIRCUITS, and constant-depth circuits cannot compute PARITY over unbounded
            input. A complexity result, not a benchmark.
          "Transformers ... specifically lack state-tracking capabilities" (arXiv
            2410.01201); "the only inference-time memory accessible to Transformers is
            their limited input window, whereas RNNs can update their internal state
            INFINITE TIMES" (arXiv 2511.10457).
        WHAT IS NOT ESTABLISHED, and this faculty does not repeat it: that recurrence
        eliminates hallucination. No paper here claims that.
        SO THE WIN IS STATE TRACKING, a structural advantage rather than a benchmark
        delta. MEASURED, parity carried in the MODEL'S OWN delta-rule state through
        interfering writes on every non-transition token:
            length     16    128   1024   8192      -> 10/10 at every length
        and a 4-state mod-4 automaton 8/8 at length 512, so it is not parity-specific. A
        tracked value survives 5,000 interfering writes; a 20,000-symbol run reads back
        correctly. LENGTH DOES NOT MATTER because the update is O(1) and the erase term is
        DIRECTIONAL.
        WHY THE HRNN IS THE RIGHT HOME: the ladder already puts decay channels in the
        weights, and a state tracker is simply the rung with decay set to NONE -- an
        accumulator, addressed through a reserved key so nothing overwrites it. Not new
        machinery; the a_log -> -inf end of a structure already installed.
        THE HONEST BOUNDARY, and it is why this is a COMPONENT and not an architecture:
        THE TRACKER MUST BE TOLD WHAT TO TRACK. Parity works because a program says
        "toggle on 1". Nothing here DISCOVERS that a task needs a counter, and the model
        does not learn to use one. State tracking becomes a capability the model CAN BE
        GIVEN, not one it acquires -- the same boundary as the write policy: mechanism
        installed, policy supplied. See holographic_statetrack."""

        question -- what can the HRNN do that attention cannot. That is a FEATURE LIST,
        not an architecture.
        THE DEMOSCENE FRAMING IS THE RIGHT ONE: a demo does not CHOOSE between the CPU and
        the blitter. It runs each on what it is good at, and THE WIN IS IN THE HANDOFF --
        the copper list changing registers mid-frame while the blitter moves memory the
        CPU could never move in time. Neither chip does the effect. THE SCHEDULE DOES.
        SO THE QUESTION IS THE DIVISION OF LABOUR AND THE SWITCH, and both measure.

            most confident quartile   mean surprise 0.746 nats
            top entropy decile        mean surprise 3.520 nats, TOP-1 7.8%

            intervening write                                  100.0% EXACT
        A 92-POINT GAP ON IDENTICAL POSITIONS, using 64 slots for 2,999 tokens.
        AND IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE, which is what makes it an architecture rather than a
        trick: HIGH ENTROPY MEANS LOW REDUNDANCY, and low redundancy is EXACTLY what a
        lossy predictor cannot reconstruct and EXACTLY what a store holds cheaply because
        there is little of it. The two failure modes are complementary BY INFORMATION
        THEORY.
            redundant tokens   the LLM predicts them free; storing them wastes slots
            surprising tokens  the LLM cannot predict them; the store holds them exactly
        Store everything and you need a slot per token; store nothing and you lose every
        fact. THE ENTROPY QUANTILE IS THE CORRECT PLACE TO CUT, and it is a fraction
        because slot count is the budget.
        AND THE SWITCH IS FREE: the model computes its own entropy every token as a
        by-product of producing logits, correlating 0.573 with its actual error. It does
        not need to be told where it is weak -- IT ALREADY PUBLISHES IT.
        WHAT THIS IS NOT: the model does not LEARN to consult the store, and no weight
        moves toward doing so. The handoff is a policy the harness runs on numbers the
        model supplies -- mechanism installed, SCHEDULE supplied, which is precisely how a
        copper list works and why the framing holds all the way down.

        A forward pass emits LOGITS, not function calls, so no weight surgery lets a model
        invoke fluid_step. But a model can emit a TOKEN, and a token can NAME a
        capability. That is how every tool-calling system works and it is the only
        mechanism that turns installed data and circuits into invoked behaviour.
        THE MYCELIUM IS THE UNUSED VOCABULARY: Qwen3.5-0.8B declares 248,320 rows against
        a tokenizer that defines 248,044, so 276 rows the model never emits and never
        reads become CALL TOKENS -- addressable by id, carried in the weights, invisible
        to anything not looking.
        THE CHAIN, all verified WEIGHTS-ONLY: allocate capabilities to free rows; a
        ridge-fitted head emits the right call in 4/4 contexts and stays SILENT in 3/3
        negatives (negatives are not optional -- a model that calls a tool on every prompt
        is worse than one that never does); a generation loop catches the token,
        dispatches, and continues. Measured end to end: 26 tokens generated during which
        the model called bundle_capacity ON ITS OWN, with the call token CONSUMED rather
        than emitted as text.
        SAFETY IS THE WHITELIST, inherited from the toolbelt: only allocated names are
        callable, a capability needing arguments the stream cannot supply is REFUSED
        rather than guessed, and every dispatch is logged.
        WHAT IT STILL IS NOT: the capability runs OUTSIDE the forward pass, in the
        harness. That is what tool calling is -- llama-server and every agent framework
        work this way. The model's contribution is DECIDING, which is the part that could

        dense attention to 6e-15 (the null test).
        RULE-0 FAILURE ON RECORD: the first screen bundled all 400 keys into one 512-dim
        vector and scored recall 0.19. mind.bundle_capacity(dim=512) answers 87 items at
        F1 1.0 -- the engine would have said "4.6x over capacity" BEFORE the build, and
        hierarchical_recall's own docstring reports 18.3% for flat recall against 100%
        with cleanup between levels. That 18.3% is the 0.19 I measured. The lesson is not
        that the idea was wrong; it is that the capacity law is a FACULTY, not folklore,
        and it was one call away.
        LEVERS THEN WALKED, measured: hierarchy (each level sized under capacity) and
        `accumulators` (lever 4 -- r summaries per block, filled round-robin, scored by
        best-match) lifted recall@8 0.667 -> 0.698 tight / 0.858 -> 0.871 loose.
        AUDITED NEGATIVE, per the engine's own law about recording where the fancy tech
        does not apply: an HRR bundle never beat a plain key CENTROID at any setting
        (0.789 vs 0.797), because this task is SUMMARIZATION FOR RANKING, not storage and
        exact retrieval. VSA earns its place where binding and clean readout are needed;
