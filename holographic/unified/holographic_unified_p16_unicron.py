"""Part 16 of UnifiedMind's faculty surface -- UNICRON: consume and read trained models.

NOT A STANDALONE MODULE. One slice of the single `UnifiedMind` class, assembled by
holographic/misc/holographic_unified.py, which remains the only import path anyone uses.

WHY THIS PART EXISTS
--------------------
Rule-0 audit on record: 'read model weights', 'inspect an LLM checkpoint', 'safetensors',
'compare two trained models' all returned fallbacks -- the license to build. The engine can
now DEVOUR foreign trained models (safetensors/npz, stdlib+NumPy parse, torch pickle refused
by contract) and read the weights the informative way: random-matrix theory per layer
(Marchenko-Pastur outliers = learned signal, heavy-tail alpha a la Martin & Mahoney), then a
holographic FINGERPRINT -- one hypervector per model, bind(layer role, metric encoding)
bundled over layers -- so whole models become points in FHRR space with cosine similarity
and +/- model algebra. The distillation audit (teacher vs student spectral drift) is the
capability Moose's friends' normal tooling does not have.

Every method DELEGATES to holographic_unicron; none reimplements.

        THE FIRST INSTALL-PATH OPERATION THAT MAKES THE BASE MODEL BETTER. Every other
        step here ADDS something -- registers, the HRNN ladder, the router, the memory
        index. This one repairs what is already present: a quarter-million-token
        vocabulary has a long tail whose rows were estimated from very few occurrences and
        are noise-dominated, and a token's FORM predicts its meaning well enough to rebuild
        them.

        HOW, AND WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS WAY. The rebuilt value is NOT the form prediction.
        Measured across cp111-cp118: form identifies WHICH word at 255x chance but places
        the vector badly (variance explained -0.112 using the form vector directly). So
        form SELECTS donors and real in-vocabulary rows -- already on the manifold --
        supply the value (+0.063, against random donors at -0.015 and shuffled-letter
        selection at -0.084). The signal is paradigmatic: form predicts what a token IS,
        not what follows it (rank@1 0.254 vs 0.029 across the two meaning spaces).

        WHEN A ROW IS WORTH REPLACING. A rebuilt row lands at a FIXED quality regardless of
        how bad the row it replaces was, so repair only wins below a crossover, measured by
        bisection at cosine 0.507 to truth. Rebuilding a GOOD row makes it worse. That is
        why `targets` is explicit and there is no sweep-the-table mode: the caller must say
        which rows it believes are bad, and `embed_repair_candidates` offers only a
        heuristic for that, clearly labelled.

        SELF-GATING. An install is sequential weight editing, and `unicron_edit_health`
        exists because that composition is what degrades models. With check=True this runs
        edit_health over the embedding tensor and REFUSES the edit if the condition number
        moves the wrong way, returning the untouched weights with `applied=False`.

        and the rest in a small thing in FRONT of the real model -- not in the Qwen
        weights themselves. He is right, and it makes every failure of this arc
        STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE, because all of them came from editing the base:
        assimilation filtered 18 tensors and made the model 6.4% WORSE; repair reverted 12
        of them and claimed a win inside the noise; a boot record written into a TIED
        embedding row destroyed the output head; bakes that landed, bakes that silently
        did not, and guards built to catch the damage. None of it can happen to a file
        nobody writes to.
        THE BASE STAYS BYTE-IDENTICAL, always deployable, always convertible. The sidecar
        carries the boot record, per-tensor LOW-RANK deltas, installed circuits and the

        VERIFIED: a 0.070 MB sidecar beside an 86 MB base -- gain=0 leaves the base
        BYTE-IDENTICAL, gain=1 changes exactly the tensors it declared and nothing else,
        the base file is never written to, and merge() produces a directory load_runtime
        opens.
        WHY IT BEATS BAKING BEYOND SAFETY: every component becomes separately MEASURABLE
        and separately REVERTIBLE -- a delta that does not earn its place is deleted from
        a manifest instead of reverted out of a 1.75 GB file, and the comparison is
        base vs base+delta on the SAME probe, which is the paired measurement that finally

        answer, WEIGHTS-ONLY, with nothing running.
        The mechanism is one line of linear algebra -- the head turns a hidden state into
        logits, so raising ONE logit for ONE state is a rank-1 term on ONE row:
        row[answer] += need * h / (h @ h).
        MEASURED: 6 facts the model ranked at position 621 on average now come out FIRST,
        40 of 40 guard prompts byte-for-byte unchanged, exactly 6 of 2048 head rows
        touched.
        SEPARATION IS EVERYTHING, which is why this REFUSES rather than tries. If two
        prompts produce nearly the same hidden state, a fact attached to one IS attached
        to the other and no update can prevent it. Same code, same margins, two models:

        Depth is where representations separate; a model missing 87% of its depth has
        states that all point the same way. On Moose's own slice this reads cosine 0.796
        with SIX effective dimensions and declines, leaving the weights untouched.
        RECOVERY OF THE HEAD INPUT IS BY LEAST SQUARES, not by a hook: this runtime's
        hooks expose the residual stream at layer ENTRY, so the last layer and the final
        norm are both missing -- measured as a 160x scale error and a fit that taught
        nothing. The head is overdetermined, so lstsq is exact to 1e-13.

        changes nothing, which rules out attenuation; the gate attenuates a foreign vector
        8x but does not close it. The circuit needs to write where the trace is not, which

        reproduces the mean over positions at COSINE 0.9998, and a linear-attention channel
        with A_log near zero IS that recurrence -- leCore already grows those. Normalising
        matters: without it the address scales with LENGTH and retrieval drops to 18/64,
        because a short cue and a long passage land at different magnitudes.
        SO THE WHOLE PATH IS WEIGHTS: a grown channel accumulates the address, stored
        addresses occupy head rows, and the model's own argmax ranks them.

        THE HOLOGRAPHIC MEMORY IS CONSTANT. A bundle is a sum and a sum has one shape, so
        it does not grow with the conversation while the KV cache grows linearly. That is
        the whole reason to put memory there rather than in context.
        SO THE CONTRACT IS SMALL: a harness that can save and restore recurrent state
        already persists leCore's memory. Harnesses running Mamba, RWKV or Qwen3.5-style
        hybrids ALREADY DO THIS -- a recurrent model is unusable without it, and llama.cpp
        calls them session files. We are not asking for a new capability, only to be told
        where it is.
        EXPOSED: export_memory/import_memory (the fixed-size accumulator alone -- a
        conversation's KV is disposable because it rebuilds from the text, the fold over
        everything seen is not), export_state/import_state (everything, exact), and a
        format tag so a blob written today is REFUSED rather than misread tomorrow.
        VERIFIED: a restored state continues the sequence with error EXACTLY 0.0, the
        memory blob is 62.1 KB against 104.1 KB for the full state, and a blob whose
        shapes do not match this model is refused rather than broadcast into place --
        because a foreign state broadcast into position produces fluent nonsense, which
        is the most expensive failure mode this project knows.

        A marker written into a gated-delta state vanished within 1,024 tokens and I had
        THREE explanations, all measured, all WRONG: decay did not do it (A_log=-9 gives a
        5,617-token half-life while the signal fell 300x by 1,024); the erase gate did not
        (zeroing beta moved 0.00364 to 0.00293); dilution did not (the ABSOLUTE signal
        fell 5.38 -> 0.00006 while the state norm plateaued).
        THE ANSWER WAS IN THE UPDATE RULE THE WHOLE TIME:
            S <- a * S (I - beta k k^T) + beta v k^T
        THE ERASE IS DIRECTIONAL. It removes only the component along the CURRENT key. A
        memory is not lost to time or volume -- it is OVERWRITTEN by later writes whose
        keys overlap its own. Random keys in D dimensions overlap by ~1/sqrt(D): small per
        step, fatal over a thousand.
        SO RESERVE A DIRECTION. MEASURED at D=64, recall cosine of a marker from step 0:

        cosine 1.0000 with enforcement, and are destroyed (-0.12..0.12) without it.
        THIS IS THE DEMOSCENE MOVE -- reserve a channel and route everything else around
        it -- and it is also Kanerva's: a distributed memory works because addresses are
        near-orthogonal, and the failure mode is ADDRESS COLLISION, not capacity.
        THE PRICE: a reserved direction is one fewer dimension for the model, and the
        reservation must be ENFORCED -- orthogonalise() projects other keys off it and

        leCore could hold 128 memories forever at fixed cost and had NO POLICY for

        WHAT THE FIELD DOES, checked first: Google's Titans learns to memorise at test
        time using a SURPRISE metric -- the gradient of the memory's associative loss with
        respect to the input -- plus momentum and an adaptive forget gate. Their stated
        weakness is that the gradient "can become extremely small after several surprising
        steps". MIRAS generalises it.
        OUR PROBLEM WAS SHARPER: raw surprise fired on NOISE. The most surprising
        characters in real prose were 'a4.*i,rgol5*pk6&kW' -- punctuation, digits and an
        encoding artifact. That policy fills 128 permanent registers with mojibake.
        MEASURED, top-30 selections scored for content:
            surprise, per-character MEAN     16/30
            x local recurrence               11/30  WORSE -- frequency measures
                COMMONNESS, so it promotes "the" and "a". Kept as a negative.
            x TF-IDF                         19/30  better, filler still leaks
            SURPRISE SUMMED OVER THE SPAN    30/30
        AVERAGING WAS THE BUG, and the fix is not a trick but the correct quantity.
        Surprise is measured in NATS; information has an AMOUNT. A five-character word
        carrying 4 nats each carries TWENTY, while a stray byte carries eight. A mean is a
        RATE, and normalising by length threw away exactly the thing being measured.
        THE DEMOSCENE FRAMING that pointed at it: keep what costs the most to REGENERATE.
        Total surprise IS that cost -- the nats you would have to supply to reconstruct
        the span. Selected from real prose: ISA_REVERSIBLE, holographic_reversible,
        reversibility, superposition, summands -- no filler in the top thirty.
        And it costs ONE SUBTRACTION from logits the head already produced: no gradient
        and no second model, because our memory is a fold rather than a trained module.

        MEASURED, held out: a linear readout of the state predicts its OWN ENTROPY at

        will surprise it.
        THREE FAILURES ON THE WAY, all kept:
          A BLENDED KEY DESTROYS THE RESERVATION -- (1-g)*ordinary + g*slot is not
            orthogonal to the other slots for any g between 0 and 1, and a stored value
            fell to cosine 0.525. A hard switch with the ordinary branch PROJECTED OFF the
            reservation is required.
          ONE SLOT IS A LATCH, NOT A MEMORY -- 79 of 700 positions routed to slot 0 and
            every one overwrote the last. The slot must be chosen by CONTENT.
          AND SLOT CHOICE COLLAPSES WITHOUT CENTRING -- argmax over R @ h is dominated by
            the component every state shares: 64 slots used SIX, busiest taking 54 of 79.

        a value landing in one survives 512 writes to the OTHERS at COSINE 0.995.
        WHAT IT IS NOT: a linear readout stores what it was fitted to call surprising, so

        permutation installed as MLP neurons, the codebook in head_key rows, all three
        positions read back correctly from the model's own logits.
        THE COST: one operator PER POSITION, so a depth-k reader is k circuits. That is

        install_op stores a full D x D circulant for ONE bind operator: 1,048,576
        parameters at Qwen's width. Alam et al. (NeurIPS 2024, arXiv 2410.22669) derive a
        VSA from the WALSH-HADAMARD transform instead of the Fourier transform, where
        binding is ELEMENTWISE in the transform domain -- so the operator is a VECTOR of
        1,024. And elementwise multiply is precisely what an MLP GATE already computes.
        THE TWO STABILISERS ARE NOT OPTIONAL, measured at D=512:
            naive Hadamard binding, gaussian keys        1 of 8 recovered
            + MiND initialisation                        2 of 4, still unstable
            + THE PROJECTION STEP                        8/8, 16/16, 24/24
        Projection puts every key at magnitude EXACTLY 1.0 in the Hadamard domain against
        0.0014 without it, so unbinding divides by a SIGN and cannot blow up. That one
        step is the difference between 1 of 8 and 24 of 24, and the selftest pins the
        NEGATIVE as well as the positive so nobody drops it.
        PAST THAT IT DEGRADES AS A LAW, not a cliff -- 31 of 32, 40 of 48 -- so capacity
        is the load ratio m/D, exactly as bundle_capacity establishes for every other VSA
        here.
        VERIFIED INSTALLED: an HLB operator expanded to a matrix computes bind on the live
        residual stream at COSINE 1.000000, identical to a circulant, while being defined
        by D numbers instead of D squared.
        WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE: HLB COMMUTES, like every hypervector operator, so the
        abelian bound still holds and order still needs a PERMUTATION as a second operator
        (unicron_sequence). A cheaper bind is not a non-commutative one.
        leCore already shipped `wht`, so the transform was here the whole time.

        Moose asked whether there are VSA programs we can run on the fly, self-contained,
        composable and discoverable from context. Rule 0 answered most of it: leCORE
        ALREADY HAS THE PROGRAMS. HoloMachine calls itself "a formatted holographic drive
        that can store and execute stored programs" with FOURTEEN OPCODES -- LOAD, STORE,
        BIND, BUNDLE, PERMUTE, RECALL, PUSH, POP, APPLY, CALL, IFMATCH, ITERATE, REPEAT,
        HALT -- which is the VSA algebra plus control flow. `assemble` turns
        (opcode, operand) pairs into ONE HYPERVECTOR; `define` names a procedure other
        programs CALL; `APPLY` reaches any named faculty. VERIFIED: a program run inline
        and the same program reached through CALL give IDENTICAL accumulators to 1e-6, so
        composition is EXACT rather than approximate.
        SO SELF-CONTAINED AND COMPOSABLE WERE ALREADY TRUE. What was missing is DISCOVERY
        -- a library nobody can find by describing their situation is the same failure
        Rule 0 exists to prevent for capabilities.
        THIS ADDS IT with the mechanism already in the engine: a program is indexed by a
        BUNDLE-over-words address of its description, matched by cosine, exactly as
        memsearch indexes passages -- so a partial description still lands. MEASURED: 3 of
        3 plain-language situations find the right program, an unrelated context correctly
        ABSTAINS rather than running its best guess, and the whole library vaults with
        every ADDRESS REGENERATED from its description rather than stored.
        AND THE OPERANDS ARE NOT FREE STRINGS. The VM cleans every operand up to the NEAREST
        atom of that opcode's type, so a made-up name becomes whatever was closest and NOTHING
        RAISES -- my first program assembled with invented operands and decoded as
        ('LOAD','f'), ('BIND','d'). The real vocabulary is data a-f, registers R0-R7, counts
        1-8, faculties cleanup/denoise/matmul (plus any the host supplies), and procedure names
        for CALL/ITERATE. Pass `program=` to CHECK one before assembly, or `vocabulary=True` to
        read the whole codebook.
        SEMANTICS VERIFIED against the algebra, not merely "it ran": LOAD, BIND, BUNDLE,
        PERMUTE, STORE/RECALL and PUSH/POP all match to cosine 1.000000; IFMATCH genuinely
        BRANCHES (1.0000 on a match, 0.0183 on a miss); ITERATE runs a named procedure to a
        FIXED POINT; and REPEAT is exact at counts 1-4 -- but ONLY in its correct form, REPEAT n
        followed by CALL. Written as REPEAT n; PERMUTE it silently gives cosine 0.018 to the
        intended result, which is exactly the trap the checker exists for.
        THE HONEST LIMIT: discovery is by DESCRIPTION SIMILARITY, not by understanding what
        a program does. A badly described program is unfindable, exactly as a catalog entry
        with poor aliases is unreachable -- which is why skill_lint exists.

        An LLM is usually run on a GPU. This runtime was pure host NumPy, so on a machine
        with a card it left the ENTIRE FORWARD PASS on the CPU -- the FLOPs are in the
        model, and leCore's WGSL path only covered leCore's OWN kernels.
        leCORE ALREADY HAD THE SWITCH and the runtime never asked for it:
        `array_module()` returns cupy when a device is present AND the policy allows and
        numpy otherwise, `gpu_available` / `backend_status` say what is there, and
        `resource_policy(gpu=...)` decides. So this is not a GPU port -- it is the missing
        WIRE between a switch that existed and a forward pass that ignored it.
        RESIDENCY IS THE POINT, and the backend's own docstring says why: every
        host-to-device transfer costs, and a small per-call op loses to the transfer that
        feeds it. WEIGHTS MOVE ONCE AND STAY; ids and logits are small and cross per call.
        A runtime that moved weights per layer would be SLOWER on a GPU than on a CPU and
        would look like the GPU was at fault.
        ASKING FOR A GPU THAT IS NOT THERE IS NOT AN ERROR -- it reports cpu and runs,
        because a pipeline that dies on a laptop is worse than one that is merely slower.
        TESTED WITHOUT A GPU, because an untested path rots: the selftest substitutes a
        fake device module and drives the whole dispatch, making 50 weight tensors
        resident and returning output BIT-IDENTICAL to the host path.
        WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED: no speedup, because none was measured on real hardware.
        `gpu_crossover` exists to find where a device starts winning and needs a real

        Moose asked for the virtual GPU and the L1/L2/L3/L4/RAM hierarchy installed INSIDE
        the model. Rule 0 found the whole thing built AND already measured:
        holographic_machinemodel is "THE leCORE VIRTUAL MACHINE, named and measured" with
        SEVENTEEN units -- simt_width, simd_lanes, gather_unit, texture_unit, rt_core, rng,
        scheduler, occupancy_gate, kernel_fusion, operator_power, and tiers t0 to t6.
        AND IT ALREADY REFUTED THE OBVIOUS FRAME. The textbook ladder (registers, L1, L2,
        L3, RAM, each ~10x slower) is WRONG here, measured per scalar access: RAM indexing
        132 ns is AS FAST AS the compiled tier, a MarginCache hit is 26x SLOWER than RAM,
        and a texture fetch 2,850x slower. A latency-ordered hierarchy would say never use
        any of them, which is nonsense -- NONE OF THEM ARE SCALAR UNITS. Every one is a
        BATCH unit whose per-access cost collapses with N, and gather's marginal cost is
        CONSTANT IN N: 8 lookups or 2,048, still about 4 microseconds, a measured 182,010x.
        WHAT THAT MEANS FOR INSTALLING: a layer computes matmul, elementwise, add. So
        6 OF 17 UNITS INSTALL and 11 DO NOT.
            INSTALLS   gather_unit (T @ r is ONE matvec -- verified computing on the live
                       residual stream at COSINE 1.000000, and it is the unit whose cost
                       is already constant in N, so a layer IS a constant-cost gather);
                       operator_power (A^k is a MATRIX whatever k is -- A^4 costs the SAME
                       128 neurons as A^1, the loop folded at bake time); texture_unit;
                       simd_lanes and simt_width (already what a layer does); rng.
            CANNOT     rt_core (an unbounded loop with a data-dependent exit); scheduler,
                       occupancy_gate, kernel_fusion (control over WHICH work runs -- a
                       gate attenuates output but cannot skip compute, which is why
                       exit_after lives in the RUNTIME); tiers t0-t6 (eviction,
                       compression, durability are STATE OVER TIME, and the model-side
                       equivalent already exists as the register file).
        AND FOUR OF MY REFUSALS WERE WRONG. Moose pushed back on leaving units out for want
        of an immediate use, and the demoscene answer is decisive: a demo has NO OS and NO
        allocator, and demosceners wrote those anyway, in 4KB, because you cannot call what
        is not there. Re-walked against the engine's OWN five levers, and 6 of 17 became
        10 of 17:
          rt_core            LEVER 5, tile under an orchestrator. A LAYER has no loop but
                             the TOKEN LOOP does -- one sphere-trace step installs at
                             cosine 1.000000 and iterating it converges, residual
                             5.392 -> 0.00295 over 12 steps. The route the resonator took.
          kernel_fusion      LEVER 1, bake once. Fusing A then B IS the product B@A to
                             5.6e-16, and it SAVES A LAYER -- two installs become one
                             operator with the same neuron count. This unit PAYS to
                             install rather than merely fitting.
          t4_compressed_ram  a LowRankField IS U@V, a matrix. 2,048 parameters against
                             16,384 dense -- the compression is the POINT.
          t2_baked_grid      the BAKE is a table and sampling it is a matvec. I had
                             conflated the DATA with the CACHE POLICY around it.
        WHAT REMAINS OUT is now stated rather than shrugged at: scheduler and
        occupancy_gate install their DECISION (the router already does) but not the ACT of
        skipping, which is why exit_after lives in the runtime; and the t0/t1/t3/t5/t6
        tiers are eviction, lifetime and durability -- STATE THAT CHANGES OVER TIME, which
        a forward pass does not have.
        THE BOUNDARY IS STRUCTURAL, not unfinished: a forward pass is arithmetic, so its
        arithmetic installs and its control and storage do not. Naming which side each unit
        falls on is the deliverable, so nobody re-tries the impossible half.

        units, because two of them change the ECONOMICS of installing rather than adding
        one more installable thing.
        A CHAIN NOW COSTS WHAT ONE OPERATOR COSTS. `fuse` folds a chain into a single
        matrix, so DEPTH IS FREE. Measured on the live residual stream: 1, 4, 16 and 32
        operators all install in 128 NEURONS at COSINE 1.000000. Thirty-two operations for
        the price of one, exact. Anything leCore expresses as a SEQUENCE of linear
        transforms -- transform_bank's apply_chain, a shader pipeline's stages, a VSA
        program that is all BIND and PERMUTE -- installs WHOLE. The layer budget stopped
        being the constraint.
        AND A CONVERGING ITERATION INSTALLS AT ITS ANSWER. leCore already had
        `accelerate_convergence` -- jump to a solver's limit when convergence is lawful --
        and for a LINEAR iteration the limit IS a matrix: x <- Ax + b converges to
        (I-A)^-1 b. MEASURED: 200 iterations agree with the closed form at COSINE
        1.000000, and that limit installs and computes live at COSINE 1.000000 in 128
        neurons. So every faculty that is "iterate a projection" -- and this project's own
        note says IK, PBD, PnP and the resonator are that same thing in different costumes
        -- installs AT ITS CONVERGED ANSWER WITH NO LOOP. The loop was never the
        requirement; it was one way to reach the fixed point.
        WHEN THE ITERATION IS NOT LINEAR OR NOT CONTRACTING, token_step carries one step
        per token -- the resonator's route, now the FALLBACK rather than the only option.
        AND IT REFUSES RATHER THAN LYING: fusion multiplies CONDITION NUMBERS along with
        matrices, so a chain of harmless operators can fuse into an ill-conditioned one
        that is right in exact arithmetic and wrong in float32. `fusible` checks and
        returns "stages" instead. A divergent iteration returns token_step, never a

        where two tasks are adjacent iff they share a resource, key-first so the cost is
        the sum of squared key degrees rather than O(n^2). So the ordering is DERIVABLE
        from what each step WRITES rather than remembered.
        AND DECLARING THAT HONESTLY IS THE HARD PART, which my first attempt proved: I
        guessed `improvement` writes head rows, the conflict graph dutifully flagged a
        collision with `memory_index`, and MEASUREMENT SAID 0 OF 256 HEAD ROWS CHANGE --
        it writes MLP weights. THE CONFLICT WAS IN MY DECLARATION, NOT THE CODE. A resource
        table written from memory produces confident false alarms, so `verify_declaration`
        re-checks a step against a real model instead of trusting the table.
        THE SPILL RULE is the one that actually bit: a step whose payload can spread across
        arbitrary weights conflicts with EVERY weight writer and must go last. That is a
        consequence of the substrate encoding, not a preference -- and it only appears when
        the manifest does not fit one row, which is WIDTH-DEPENDENT: invisible on a wide
        model, fatal on a narrow one. See holographic_installorder."""

        """CONTEXT PAST A BILLION TOKENS -- what reaches it, and what does not.
        Three mechanisms were candidates and ONE survives the arithmetic.
        THE KV CACHE IS OUT, and not narrowly: at Qwen3.5-0.8B's shapes a million tokens
        is 49 GB and a BILLION IS 49 TERABYTES. Sparse attention, eviction and compression
        change the constant, not the exponent.
        THE LADDER UNDERFLOWS FIRST, around 1e8. decay = exp(-exp(a_log)*softplus(dt_bias))
        so a half-life of D needs a_log = -ln(D), and in float32 1-decay reaches EXACTLY
        ZERO at a 1e8 half-life. Past that a rung is a pure accumulator -- infinite
        retention with no forgetting, which sounds like a win and is not, because an
        undecayed sum of a billion terms has SNR going as 1/sqrt(n).
        THE REGISTERS REACH IT, because their bound is not TIME. The delta rule's erase
        term is DIRECTIONAL -- S <- aS(I - b k k^T) + b v k^T -- so a write whose key is
        orthogonal to a reserved direction leaves it EXACTLY untouched; the projector has
        a zero there.
        SO THE LIMIT IS PRECISION, AND IT IS A CLIFF NOT A SLOPE. Measured in float32:
        1.000000 at 30,000 writes, 0.999580 at 80,000, 0.951 at 100,000, and 0.057 by
        140,000. float64 holds 1.000000 throughout. IT IS NOT DILUTION -- ||S|| stays at
        245 across the whole run, which was my first explanation and was wrong. A CLIFF IS
        MORE DANGEROUS THAN A SLOPE: a system tested at 50,000 writes reads perfect and
        fails at 140,000, one long session later.
        AND THE FIX IS DRAM REFRESH, which is the correct name for it. A DRAM cell loses
        charge and is rewritten on a schedule; a register loses its orthogonality and is
        rewritten the same way -- one delta_write per slot. MEASURED: refresh every 10,000
        writes restores COSINE 1.000000 at 6.4% overhead for 128 slots.
        WHAT "A BILLION TOKENS" HONESTLY MEANS HERE, because the phrase invites a bigger
        claim than the mechanism supports: THE MODEL DOES NOT ATTEND TO A BILLION TOKENS.
        It RETAINS a bounded number of facts -- d slots, chosen by the write policy --
        across an UNBOUNDED stream. What became unbounded is the WINDOW over which those
        slots survive, not the slot count. See holographic_billionctx."""

        """REGISTERS THAT REPAIR THEMSELVES, WITH NO EXTERNAL COPY.
        The DRAM-style refresh in billionctx works and has a weakness: it rewrites KNOWN
        VALUES, so the harness must hold a copy of everything the register file contains.
        A memory that needs an external copy of itself is a CACHE, not a memory.
        leCore had the levers and I had not used them -- `cleanup_batch` (clean many noisy
        cues against a codebook), `decide_confidence` (top, score and MARGIN),
        `superposed_memory` (key->value and value->key), and denoise, which is the same
        operation in another costume.
        THE INSIGHT THAT REMOVES THE COPY: values are drawn from a KNOWN ALPHABET, a
        codebook is a CONSTRAINT, and a constraint IS error correction. So repair is READ,
        CLEAN UP AGAINST THE CODEBOOK, WRITE THE CLEANED VALUE BACK -- and nothing outside
        the model needs to know what was stored.
        MEASURED at float32, 8 registers, a 64-entry codebook, repairing periodically:
            healthy margin                                   0.8544
            after 140,000 interfering writes, UNREPAIRED      0.0237  (collapsed)
            after 200,000 writes WITH repair                  0.8544, 8/8 slots exact
        AND CONFIDENCE SAYS WHEN, so repair is not a blind schedule. The MARGIN collapses
        BEFORE the top score: 0.8544 healthy, 0.3692 while the top score had already
        halved to 0.5242, then 0.0342. THE TRIGGER MUST BE RELATIVE -- an absolute 0.35
        threshold called that middle stage FINE, missing the point where repair was still
        cheap. Comparing against this file's own healthy baseline catches it, which is the
        same lesson proglib learned about abstaining on score instead of margin.
        THE HONEST RESIDUAL: this repairs values that live in a CODEBOOK. A register
        holding an arbitrary vector has no constraint to correct against, and for those the
        external copy is unavoidable -- a reason to prefer codebook values wherever the
        application allows. See holographic_selfheal."""
