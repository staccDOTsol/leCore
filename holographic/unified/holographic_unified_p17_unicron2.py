"""Part 17 of UnifiedMind's faculty surface -- UNICRON, second half.

NOT A STANDALONE MODULE. One slice of the single `UnifiedMind` class, assembled by
holographic/misc/holographic_unified.py, which remains the only import path anyone uses.

WHY THIS PART EXISTS: the wild-release size gate. Part 16 grew to 3,407 lines against the
2,000-line cap (tests/test_unified_split.py -- "the whole point was file size"), so the
unicron surface is split at a method boundary. The cut is MECHANICAL, not semantic: both
halves are the same devour-and-read-models family, every method still delegates to
holographic_unicron and friends, and UnifiedMind inherits both parts so no faculty changed
its name, its behavior, or its discoverability. (The alternative -- trimming faculties to
fit -- would trade a lint for a regression.)

Every method DELEGATES; none reimplements.

        docs/COMPETITIVE_NOOA.md checks arXiv:2607.20709 and lists six NOOA capabilities.
        FIVE ARE HARNESS FEATURES -- pass-by-reference previews, code-as-action in a
        persistent REPL, typed return validation, sandboxed execution, event history --
        and none of those live in weights. They are things a RUNNER does.
        THE SIXTH IS THE ONE WITH A NUMBER: a long-term memory subsystem with ACT-R
        ACTIVATION RANKING and DECAY-BASED FORGETTING, measured at +11.8 RHAE POINTS over
        the same agent with markdown notes. leCore was marked PARTIAL -- recall exists,
        the curation and decay did not.
        AND WE HAD ALREADY INSTALLED THE HARD PART WITHOUT NAMING IT. ACT-R's base-level
        activation is A = ln(sum_j t_j^-d) with d~0.5, A POWER LAW over how long ago each
        use was. The HRNN ladder is a sum of EXPONENTIALS at GEOMETRIC half-lives, and a
        geometric sum of exponentials APPROXIMATES a power law. Measured against t^-0.5
        over five decades:
            2 rungs   R^2 0.85055
            4 rungs   R^2 0.99282   <-- what install_lecore puts in by default
            6 rungs   R^2 0.99891
        SO THE LADDER IS ACT-R BASE-LEVEL ACTIVATION IN THE WEIGHTS, rather than in a
        SQLite file beside the agent, and the state IS the log of use times.
        THE RUNG WEIGHTS ARE NOT OPTIONAL, and this is the trap: reading the ladder with
        UNIT weights over-counts the long rungs, because every rung contributes about 1
        for an item younger than its half-life. Measured, that ranked ONE RECENT USE BELOW
        TWO OLD ONES -- inverting the entire point of a recency-weighted memory. The fit is
        closed-form least squares over log-spaced ages and the selftest pins the failure.
        WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED: NOOA's +11.8 was measured on RHAE with a full agent loop.
        Nothing here reproduces that, and leCore still has no result on any external
        agentic benchmark -- which the competitive note already says plainly. The claim is
        that the MECHANISM is present and correct. See holographic_actr."""

        From the research survey's FIRST recommendation: AlphaEdit (Fang et al., ICLR 2025
        Outstanding Paper, arXiv 2410.02355) projects a weight perturbation onto the NULL
        SPACE of the preserved-knowledge key matrix before applying it, so preserved keys
        produce unchanged output. The paper reports it boosts locate-then-edit methods "by
        an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely".
        WHY IT MATTERS HERE: every install in this pipeline was checked by MEASUREMENT --
        bit-identical when empty, or perplexity did not regress. That is weaker than a
        CONSTRUCTION that cannot disturb what it must not touch.
        MEASURED, the same bind operator installed three ways:
            projection            kept energy   perplexity   bind cosine
            none (raw)                   1.00       7.3772     1.000000

            (baseline, no install)          -       7.2659
        THE COST OF INSTALLING FELL SEVENFOLD, +1.53% to +0.22%, AND THE OPERATOR STILL
        COMPUTES EXACTLY at cosine 1.000000. The circuit does the same arithmetic in
        directions the model was not using.
        AND THE HONEST CAVEAT, which a small model exposes and the paper's setting hides:
        ALPHAEDIT'S GUARANTEE NEEDS AN ACTUAL NULL SPACE, and a full-rank key covariance
        has none. Measured, 600 preserved keys at width 128 gave eigenvalues spanning 2.03
        to 1.29e4 -- THE SMALLEST IS 2.03, NOT ZERO. So this computes a LOW-ENERGY
        SUBSPACE and the disturbance FALLS 3.2x rather than vanishing. The guarantee
        degrades gracefully into a reduction, and calling it a proof here would be the
        overclaim. It is a width-and-sample question: 600 keys at width 1024 leaves a real
        null space, at width 128 it does not. See holographic_nullspace."""

        Moose read that recurrent models may be more capable than transformers. The
        literature's ACTUAL claim is narrower than "RNNs beat LLMs and do not
        hallucinate", and the narrow version is the useful one because it is PROVEN:
          Merrill and Sabharwal show saturated transformers are CONSTANT-DEPTH THRESHOLD
            CIRCUITS, and constant-depth circuits cannot compute PARITY over unbounded
            input. A complexity result, not a benchmark.
          "Transformers ... specifically lack state-tracking capabilities" (arXiv
            2410.01201); "the only inference-time memory accessible to Transformers is
            their limited input window, whereas RNNs can update their internal state
            INFINITE TIMES" (arXiv 2511.10457).
        WHAT IS NOT ESTABLISHED, and this faculty does not repeat it: that recurrence
        eliminates hallucination. No paper here claims that.
        SO THE WIN IS STATE TRACKING, a structural advantage rather than a benchmark
        delta. MEASURED, parity carried in the MODEL'S OWN delta-rule state through
        interfering writes on every non-transition token:
            length     16    128   1024   8192      -> 10/10 at every length
        and a 4-state mod-4 automaton 8/8 at length 512, so it is not parity-specific. A
        tracked value survives 5,000 interfering writes; a 20,000-symbol run reads back
        correctly. LENGTH DOES NOT MATTER because the update is O(1) and the erase term is
        DIRECTIONAL.
        WHY THE HRNN IS THE RIGHT HOME: the ladder already puts decay channels in the
        weights, and a state tracker is simply the rung with decay set to NONE -- an
        accumulator, addressed through a reserved key so nothing overwrites it. Not new
        machinery; the a_log -> -inf end of a structure already installed.
        THE HONEST BOUNDARY, and it is why this is a COMPONENT and not an architecture:
        THE TRACKER MUST BE TOLD WHAT TO TRACK. Parity works because a program says
        "toggle on 1". Nothing here DISCOVERS that a task needs a counter, and the model
        does not learn to use one. State tracking becomes a capability the model CAN BE
        GIVEN, not one it acquires -- the same boundary as the write policy: mechanism
        installed, policy supplied. See holographic_statetrack."""

        question -- what can the HRNN do that attention cannot. That is a FEATURE LIST,
        not an architecture.
        THE DEMOSCENE FRAMING IS THE RIGHT ONE: a demo does not CHOOSE between the CPU and
        the blitter. It runs each on what it is good at, and THE WIN IS IN THE HANDOFF --
        the copper list changing registers mid-frame while the blitter moves memory the
        CPU could never move in time. Neither chip does the effect. THE SCHEDULE DOES.
        SO THE QUESTION IS THE DIVISION OF LABOUR AND THE SWITCH, and both measure.
        MEASURED ON ONE 3,000-TOKEN STREAM:
            most confident quartile   mean surprise 0.746 nats
            top entropy decile        mean surprise 3.520 nats, TOP-1 7.8%
            THE SAME TOKENS, recalled from the recurrent store after every
            intervening write                                  100.0% EXACT
        A 92-POINT GAP ON IDENTICAL POSITIONS, using 64 slots for 2,999 tokens.
        AND IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE, which is what makes it an architecture rather than a
        trick: HIGH ENTROPY MEANS LOW REDUNDANCY, and low redundancy is EXACTLY what a
        lossy predictor cannot reconstruct and EXACTLY what a store holds cheaply because
        there is little of it. The two failure modes are complementary BY INFORMATION
        THEORY.
            redundant tokens   the LLM predicts them free; storing them wastes slots
            surprising tokens  the LLM cannot predict them; the store holds them exactly
        Store everything and you need a slot per token; store nothing and you lose every
        fact. THE ENTROPY QUANTILE IS THE CORRECT PLACE TO CUT, and it is a fraction
        because slot count is the budget.
        AND THE SWITCH IS FREE: the model computes its own entropy every token as a
        by-product of producing logits, correlating 0.573 with its actual error. It does
        not need to be told where it is weak -- IT ALREADY PUBLISHES IT.
        WHAT THIS IS NOT: the model does not LEARN to consult the store, and no weight
        moves toward doing so. The handoff is a policy the harness runs on numbers the
        model supplies -- mechanism installed, SCHEDULE supplied, which is precisely how a
        copper list works and why the framing holds all the way down.

        eviction made that survivable by overwriting the least active slot, but eviction
        is a loss, and a flat file is the reason it was needed.

            original                     2.81 MB

            EXACTLY-ZERO BYTES           2.26 MB     36% OF THE FILE
        and tensor by tensor: 1.45 MB IDENTICAL to the layer it came from (just
        renumbered), 2.72 MB GROWN by the ladder, and 0.00 MB GENUINELY DIFFERENT
        VALUES. THE INSTALL ADDS 3.43 MB OF FILE FOR ZERO MB OF NEW INFORMATION.
        AND leCORE ALREADY NAMES THIS AS AN ERROR. `bank_or_formula` is the demoscene
        economy as a measured gate -- keep the FORMULA, not the samples -- and says
        outright that a bank of things a cheap formula gives you for free is NEGATIVE
        VALUE. We were banking zeros.
        SO THE RECIPE STORES RULES: a blank layer is a SHAPE, a renumbered layer is the
        SAME ARRAY under a different key, a ladder-widened tensor is a base tensor plus a
        small remainder, a register reservation is 64 BITS of seed. Only the router
        direction and the improvement correction are genuinely new, and both are small.
        MEASURED: 6.24 MB expands from 2.31 MB of real arrays -- 28 renames, 13 all-zero
        shapes, 18 base-plus-padding, 29 actually new -- and expand() rebuilds EVERY
        TENSOR BYTE-EXACT, which is the only thing that makes a recipe a format rather
        than a hope.
        ONE TRAP WORTH THE COMMENT: the padding is NOT always zero. The ladder writes real
        a_log values into the new heads, and assuming otherwise failed the exact rebuild on
        in_proj_ba where rows 8 and 9 carry the new rungs. The recipe stores the REMAINDER,
        which is nothing for a blank pad and a handful of rows for a rung.
        NOT A REPLACEMENT for the safetensors output -- other people's loaders need every

        A forward pass emits LOGITS, not function calls, so no weight surgery lets a model
        invoke fluid_step. But a model can emit a TOKEN, and a token can NAME a
        capability. That is how every tool-calling system works and it is the only
        mechanism that turns installed data and circuits into invoked behaviour.
        THE MYCELIUM IS THE UNUSED VOCABULARY: Qwen3.5-0.8B declares 248,320 rows against
        a tokenizer that defines 248,044, so 276 rows the model never emits and never
        reads become CALL TOKENS -- addressable by id, carried in the weights, invisible
        to anything not looking.
        THE CHAIN, all verified WEIGHTS-ONLY: allocate capabilities to free rows; a
        ridge-fitted head emits the right call in 4/4 contexts and stays SILENT in 3/3
        negatives (negatives are not optional -- a model that calls a tool on every prompt
        is worse than one that never does); a generation loop catches the token,
        dispatches, and continues. Measured end to end: 26 tokens generated during which
        the model called bundle_capacity ON ITS OWN, with the call token CONSUMED rather
        than emitted as text.
        SAFETY IS THE WHITELIST, inherited from the toolbelt: only allocated names are
        callable, a capability needing arguments the stream cannot supply is REFUSED
        rather than guessed, and every dispatch is logged.

        clusters and orphans, and unresolved links reported rather than swallowed. The

        notes open in Obsidian.

        the corpus resident (retrieval into the residual stream, no context window
        spent), the fact checker builds evidence from the SAME notes so retrievable ==
        assertable, and residents WRITE notes back with author/kind frontmatter -- a
        swarm conclusion becomes a linked note that later retrieval finds, and is never
        mistaken for something a person wrote. A human and a swarm keep one notebook.

        Why the centroid was beatable at all: it ranks a block by its MEAN inner
        product while routing needs the MAX, so it is a heuristic that silently misses.
        mode="ball" groups keys by SIMILARITY (deterministic k-means) and uses the
        admissible bound max q.k <= q.c + r||q|| to skip clusters that PROVABLY cannot

        MEASURED head to head on the trained subject: ball at 80 clusters gives EXACT
        top-8 for 100% of queries while scoring 38.5% of keys; the centroid screen gives
        0.87 recall at 80%. End to end at 50 clusters: top-1 agreement 1.0000 and
        perplexity 4.9957 against a dense 4.9969, versus 0.9975 / 5.0113 for the
        centroid.
        rank>0 adds the BOUNDARY READ: all keys share one low-rank shell, so a query is
        projected into it ONCE and every score becomes an r-dim dot against stored
        coordinates -- the key is never read. Each key's TAIL NORM certifies the read
        (|approx - true| <= tail*||q||), so only keys whose upper bound can crack the
        running top-k are rescored exactly. MEASURED: exact top-8 at 33.5% of dense
        flops (rank 8) versus 38.5% for the bound alone. Per-cluster bases were refused
        -- an ~8-key cluster cannot amortize its own r*d projection; the shared shell
        can, because it is projected once for the whole volume. Partition the KV volume into blocks, give
        each a fixed-size screen (its key centroid), score the SCREENS (T/block work),
        then pay full attention price only inside the few blocks the screens point at,
        plus a recent window. This is the boundary/volume accounting turned into a
        shortcut: the information is concentrated (90% of softmax mass in ~6% of keys),
        so a summary can find it without scanning everything.
        MEASURED on the trained subject at 400 tokens: 38% of keys scored -> 0.998 top-1
        agreement (+0.26% perplexity); 26% -> 0.983. Allowing every block reproduces
        dense attention to 6e-15 (the null test).
        RULE-0 FAILURE ON RECORD: the first screen bundled all 400 keys into one 512-dim
        vector and scored recall 0.19. mind.bundle_capacity(dim=512) answers 87 items at
        F1 1.0 -- the engine would have said "4.6x over capacity" BEFORE the build, and
        hierarchical_recall's own docstring reports 18.3% for flat recall against 100%
        with cleanup between levels. That 18.3% is the 0.19 I measured. The lesson is not
        that the idea was wrong; it is that the capacity law is a FACULTY, not folklore,
        and it was one call away.
        LEVERS THEN WALKED, measured: hierarchy (each level sized under capacity) and
        `accumulators` (lever 4 -- r summaries per block, filled round-robin, scored by
        best-match) lifted recall@8 0.667 -> 0.698 tight / 0.858 -> 0.871 loose.
        AUDITED NEGATIVE, per the engine's own law about recording where the fancy tech
        does not apply: an HRR bundle never beat a plain key CENTROID at any setting
        (0.789 vs 0.797), because this task is SUMMARIZATION FOR RANKING, not storage and
        exact retrieval. VSA earns its place where binding and clean readout are needed;
