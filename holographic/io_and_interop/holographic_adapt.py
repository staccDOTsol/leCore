"""ADAPT -- read a model we have never seen, from its tensors alone.

Moose: Unicron should install leCore into ANY model we choose, and we already
demux and decompose UNLABELED datasets, so this should be easier. He is right,
and the framing is the useful part: A CHECKPOINT IS AN UNLABELED DATASET. It is
a few hundred arrays with names someone else chose, and every question we ask of
it -- which axis is the carrier, which is the payload, where does the structure
repeat -- is a question leCore already answers for unlabeled data.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY UNKNOWN about a strange model:
    where the layers are          a numeric field that REPEATS in the names
    the hidden width              the dimension that appears in the most tensors
    which tensor is the vocabulary  2-D, one axis hidden, the other much larger
    whether embeddings are tied     is there a separate head tensor at all
    which axis is IN vs OUT         `analyze_axes` -- carrier versus payload
    which rows are free             the tokenizer's added_tokens, when present

NONE OF THAT NEEDS A CONFIG. Measured on a real checkpoint with config.json
withheld: 4 layer indices recovered from the names, hidden 128 recovered as the
modal dimension (appearing in 40 tensors against 15 for the next), the
vocabulary tensor identified by shape, and tied-versus-untied answered by
whether an lm_head exists.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR INSTALLING: install_lecore needs six facts -- depth, width,
head, tie, free rows, and where the residual stream is -- and every one of them
is inferable. A config file is a convenience, not a requirement, and treating it
as a requirement is what made the old pipeline architecture-specific.

THE HONEST LIMIT, and it is why this REPORTS CONFIDENCE rather than a verdict:
inference from shapes is a strong prior, not a proof. A model whose hidden width
happens to equal its head count, or whose naming uses a different numeric field,
will be read wrongly -- so every field comes back with the evidence that
produced it, and `confidence` is LOW when the evidence is thin. A wrong guess
that announces itself is recoverable; a wrong guess that does not is the most
expensive failure this project knows.
